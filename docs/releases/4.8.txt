Version 4.8
===========

Released: July 12, 2024


Changes
-------


Celery
^^^^^^

Increased the Celery workers maximum memory per child from 400MB to 500MB.
This lowers the occurrence of workers being killed.

Decrease the Celery workers maximum tasks per child from 1000 to 500. This
recycles workers sooner to clear out any lost memory due to unmanaged memory
leaks external to Mayan EDMS.

File metadata
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support was added for enabling or disabling file metadata driver per document
type.

Added a new Ollama file metadata app. This app is able to interface with
Ollama models for document file introspection and analysis.

Split the file metadata EXIF and MSG drivers to their own app named
`mayan.apps.file_metadata_exif.apps.FileMetadataEXIFApp` and
`mayan.apps.file_metadata_msg.apps.FileMetadataMSGApp`.

Added per file metadata option to enable the driver for new document types.

Made the file metadata view columns sortable.

Added a column to the document file metadata list showing the full path to
an entry including the driver's internal name.

Added file metadata API views.

Added API view to display registered file metadata drivers, document type
configuration, document file driver list, document file metadata entries,
submit document files for processing.


Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added support for deleting notifications via the user interface and API.


Platform
^^^^^^^^

Split the Docker templates into their own call named
`mayan.apps.platform_docker`.


Templating
^^^^^^^^^^

Added support for syntax highlighting. The widget theme can be changed using
the new setting named `TEMPLATING_WIDGET_HIGHLIGHT_THEME`.

The font family of the templating widget is now monospaced.

Ensured the overscroll of the edit and preview fields does not affect the
parent element.

Restricted the scrolling of the edit, preview, and result fields to be
vertical only.

Document sandbox errors are now returned in the result fields instead of a
view message.

Fixed the latest file template helper.

Added a helper that returns the active version of a document.

Added a `to_base64` template filter. This filter turns binary data into
a base64 encoded string for sending to Ollama models or via the workflow
HTTP action. The filter also accepts an optional `altchars` argument.

Added select2 support and a custom select2 HTML template to the templating
field's model attributes and filter/tags dropdowns. This enabled
autocompletion to the fields.


User interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system menu icon was replaced.

Removed hardcoded dropdown markup in `partials/list/toolbar.html`. Instead
the general purpose template `actions_dropdown.html` is now used.

Split the menu link resolution into two stages. This allowed caching the class
results of the navigation object inspection resulting in faster page loading
and lower CPU usage in the frontend process.

Removed AJAX navigation exclusion for the `.btn-multi-item-action` class
and shifted the responsibility of interaction from HTML/CSS to JavaScript.

Renamed `menu_about` to `menu_system` to reflect it true purpose.

Split Bootstrap specific markup and style into the new `appearance_bootstrap`
app. This makes restyling Mayan EDMS much easier.

Humanized the document file size column.

Added support for link hover titles.

Added support for menus dropdowns without text.

Removed the text from the user and system menus to reduce space used.

Added hover title for the reload button, system menu, user menu, and messages
link.

Improved `SourceColumn` resolution of `kwargs`. Keyword arguments can now
access the template context reducing the need for lambdas.

Removed the specialized and custom animated list toolbar checkbox and instead
use a styled standard HTML checkbox which makes this feature more compatible
with multiple browsers.

Tweaked the FontAwesome icon spacing and composition styling.

Improved the logic to show or hide the filter clear icon.

The filter clear icon is now shown if a filter has a value after a refresh
or full page load.

Added persistent view mode setting. This features stores the user selected
view mode for a specific list view. A user view was added to show the detail
of each user view modes.

Update the message delete view to use the `MultipleObjectDeleteView`
instead of a custom `MultipleObjectConfirmActionView`.


Workflows
^^^^^^^^^

The workflow instance log entry is now available to the workflow instance
states actions. This allows actions to have access to the log entry that
triggered the workflow transition regardless of the current state or
transition of the workflow. The workflow state action context is now
composed of the keys: `workflow_instance`, `workflow_instance_context`,
`action`, and `log_entry`.
