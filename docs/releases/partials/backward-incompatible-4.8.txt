Split form related code and moved it to its own app. All imports from
`django.forms` are updated to explicit imports from `mayan.apps.forms`
modules. New form modules are: `form_fields`, `formsets`, `form_widgets`,
`forms`.

The setting `VIEWS_SHOW_DROPZONE_SUBMIT_BUTTON` has been renamed to
`FORMS_SHOW_DROPZONE_SUBMIT_BUTTON`.

The module `navigation.classes` has been split into three separate modules:
`navigation.links`, `navigation.menus`, and `navigation.source_columns`.

The default Docker image no longer includes Debian Chinese and Korean font
packages. Removed package names: `fonts-arphic-uming`, `fonts-arphic-ukai`,
`fonts-unfonts-core`.

Updated the permission required to view the list of detected file metadata
drivers from "view file metadata" to "view settings". This change is
required as the driver list view now may contain low level credentials.

Renamed development setup targets. Changed the prefix `setup-dev` to
`dev-setup`. Updated the OS target to include the OS name `ubuntu`.

Renamed the icon class `fontawesomecss` to `fontawesome-css`.

Pass the value to `SourceColumnWidget` subclasses during initialization
instead of during rendering. 3rd party apps using custom column widgets
need to be updated.
